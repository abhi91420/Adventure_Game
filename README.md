## Adventure Game

This is a text endless endventure game using JAVA

NOTE - The dialogues used in these game are for pure purpose of fun and things that i find funny

This program utilizes the OOPS concepts to make the code modular and efficient

# I would like to explain them below on how the components were created and organized

1. In the game program I have created 2 Core components
    a. Characters
    b. Enemies
2. Both of them have an inteface that defines the basic traits of each component
3. Then there are classes that impliment these methods in the interface
4. The implimentation can vary from class to class
5. To Organize these files I have used packages to group them into respective packages 
6. Finally to create Pauses in the program I have used Thread.sleep() method to make it a clean and playable game
